    During the consultation, effective communication, detailed assessment, and patient education are
     paramount. Post-consultation, meticulous documentation and patient support ensure continuity of care.

     accessibility. Lastly, a collaborative, patient-centered approach and adherence to ethical 
     and legal standards are essential for optimal patient outcomes.
