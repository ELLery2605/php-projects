    Bits Care Medical Consult was established in 2010 by 
    Dr. Emily Hughes, a visionary in integrating technology 
    with healthcare services. The company began with a small team of
     healthcare professionals dedicated to providing high-quality,
      patient-centered consultations. Recognizing the potential of
       telemedicine, Bits Care quickly expanded its services to 
       include remote consultations, making healthcare accessible to
        patients in underserved areas. Over the years, they have 
        developed a robust electronic health records system,
         ensuring seamless information flow and efficient patient 
         care. Today, Bits Care Medical Consult is renowned for its 
         innovative approach, multidisciplinary team, and commitment 
         to improving patient 
    outcomes through cutting-edge technology and compassionate care.
